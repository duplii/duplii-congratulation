# Duplii Congratulation

This is a congratulation screen that will be presented to our user when he performs certain actions such as signing up leads with their company. It looks unbearably cool.

This repo actually contains very little code. We are mostly reusing stuff from other repos that contain most of the logic. Here we just need to build the markup, apply styles and adjust a couple of things that are specific to this screen.

## Live demo

A live demo of this project can be found [here](http://duplii.github.io/duplii-congratulation "Duplii | Congratulation Animation").
